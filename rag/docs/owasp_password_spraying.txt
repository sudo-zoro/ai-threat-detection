Password spraying is an attack where attackers try a few common
passwords across many accounts instead of targeting one account with
many passwords.

This avoids account lockouts and is harder to detect.

Common indicators: - Many accounts receiving login attempts with the
same password - Slow login attempts across a long duration - Attempts
from the same IP targeting multiple users

Mitigation techniques: - Detect multiple failed logins across accounts -
Enforce strong password requirements - Use anomaly detection systems -
Implement MFA
