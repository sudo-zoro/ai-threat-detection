Account takeover occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to a
user account.

This may happen through phishing, credential stuffing, brute force, or
malware.

Common indicators: - Login from a new country or device - Sudden
password change - Suspicious activity after login - Access at unusual
times

Mitigation techniques: - Notify users of new device logins - Require MFA
for sensitive actions - Monitor geographic anomalies - Detect unusual
user behavior patterns
