Credential stuffing is an attack where attackers use leaked usernames
and passwords from previous data breaches to try logging into other
services.

Since many users reuse passwords, attackers can gain access without
guessing.

Common indicators: - Multiple login attempts across many accounts -
Login attempts from different geographic locations - Sudden spike in
failed logins

Mitigation techniques: - Enforce strong password policies - Enable MFA -
Detect abnormal login patterns - Monitor login attempts from suspicious
IP addresses
