Rate limiting controls how many login attempts can be made within a time
period.

It helps prevent automated attacks like brute force and password
spraying.

Best practices: - Limit login attempts per minute - Temporarily block IP
after repeated failures - Introduce CAPTCHA after multiple attempts -
Monitor login attempt patterns

Rate limiting is a key defense mechanism against automated attacks.
