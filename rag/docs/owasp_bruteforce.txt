Brute force attacks involve repeated login attempts using many password
combinations to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

Attackers may use automated tools to try thousands of passwords per
minute. These attacks often result in a high number of failed login
attempts.

Common indicators: - Multiple failed login attempts in a short time -
Login attempts from unusual locations - Attempts during late night hours

Mitigation techniques: - Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Rate
limit login attempts - Account lockout after repeated failures - CAPTCHA
verification - IP blocking and monitoring
