Suspicious login behavior includes unusual patterns that may indicate an
attack or compromised credentials.

Common suspicious signals: - Login at odd hours (late night / early
morning) - Login from a new country - Login from multiple locations
within a short time - Sudden increase in failed login attempts

These behaviors may indicate: - Brute force attacks - Credential
stuffing - Compromised accounts - Bot-driven login attempts

Security teams should monitor and investigate such anomalies quickly.
